# E-Store

Online store built in the MVC paradigm

## Learning Experience

- Applied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture: By structuring my application according to the MVC design pattern, I separated the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic, leading to a more organized and maintainable codebase.
- Leveraged JavaFX for the user interface: Utilizing JavaFX allowed me to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience of the electronic store.
- Practiced encapsulation and OOP principles: By encapsulating data and behavior within classes and utilizing access modifiers appropriately, I achieved better code organization, reduced coupling, and improved code reusability.
- Implemented data models for the electronic store: Developing dedicated classes for products, customers, orders, etc., enabled me to represent and manage the core entities of the electronic store accurately and efficiently.
- Utilized event-driven programming: Leveraging event handlers and listeners in JavaFX, I implemented interactive functionalities such as button clicks, form submissions, and user input validation, enhancing the interactivity of the store's user interface.
